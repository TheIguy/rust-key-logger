It works pretty well using obfstr. It runs immediately - I made it notify you but you could obviously change that. No Windows Defender flags whatsoever. Even when I ran a Microsoft Defender antivirus scan, it came back clean. 

It creates a .bat file which you can open in Notepad to see your results. It tricked me a couple times when I left it running by accident without realizing it was still logging my keystrokes.
